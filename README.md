Workshop: Multiverse Analyses
Giulia Calignano, Università degli Studi di Padova
In this workshop on Multiverse Analyses, Giulia will introduction attendees to the multiverse concept and why it matters–especially in multilab contexts–and discuss how the multiverse approach addresses researcher degrees of freedom across labs. She’ll then go over how the MB2P (Pupillometry) spin-off project is implementing a multiverse analysis approach using the data from the main MB2 study.
